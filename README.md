# Spatial OS

A Universal, Open Infrastructure for Persistent, Shared Reality.

Spatial OS provides a neutral spatial substrate for AR/VR systems:
persistent anchors, shared coordinate spaces, identity, permissions,
and real-time synchronization—designed to be device-agnostic and
engine-neutral.

This project is infrastructure, not an application.
